Contains MATLAB source code and example configuration files to generate
digital reference objects in DICOM format for testing dynamic-contrast
enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) kinetic-model analysis software packages.

MATLAB version:

Developed and tested in MATLAB 2019a
Required toolboxes: Image processing


To execute: 'run_construct_digital_phantom.m'

Set-up and configuration:-

In 'run_construct_digital_phantom.m' :-

    % A description string for the phantom...
    config.PHANTOM_DESC   = 'examp_001';
      
    % ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    config.TEST_FLAG      = false;   % Gives more debug information if set...

    config.WRITE_OUTPUT   = true;    % Disable any writing of files if this is set 'false'...

    % ...and check: 'phantom_config_all_<STUDY>.m'   
    
                % This specifies general study configuration parameters...
                % (See e.g. '.\config\phantom_config_all_examples.m' as an
                % example)

    % ...and write: 'phantom_config_<PHANTOM_ID>.m'  
    
                % This specifies phantom-specific configuration parameters...

                % N.B. If adding a new model implementation, also add relevant code
                % to the switch statements on line 227 of 'run_construct_digital_phantom.m'
                % and on line 16 of 'dce_calc_gd_curves_from_model.m'.

    % Two further comma-separated variable 'spreadsheet' files must be
    % suppled:-
    
    % .\aif\<AIF-FILE>.csv    % Contains 't (seconds), [Gd] (mM)' pairs (as a
                              % blood concentration) to specify the arterial

Sample DRO DICOM data:

Sample output for some typical example cases are provided in the form of DICOM format DROs 
in the 'sample_ouput' folder.

Miscellaneous information:

Sample configuration files for running the sample eTM DRO in the MADYM package are supplied 
in the 'misc' folder.
